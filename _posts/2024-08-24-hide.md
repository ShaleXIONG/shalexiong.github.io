I went this place with a friend visiting U.K. 
He is a pescatarian, who is a vegetarian and plus eats fish and seafood.
It was the worst day walking around London, because it was raining and cloudy.
Nevertheless, the restaurant is located in central London, close to Green Park tube station; it is next to the main road, hence very easy to find.
It is a very bright and posh restaurant inside.
I guess that many businesses meetings are extended here, but we are just "tourists".
The tasting menu is simple and not a long long list.

The canap√©s (pictures not given) was ok as nothing surprised.
However, the first course did not make a great start for me: a tomato and a pickle.
The problem was, both of them are way too sour for me.
The dressing was a bit too running and did not balance out the sour.
The leafy decoration on top of tomato and pickle, sadly, also did not do much.

The nest egg (picture not given) was as expect, and only as expect.
It had smooth taste, of a bit of egg-ish flavour.
However, did I remember anything? Well, certainly no.
Let jump to the main, the lamb, which was the only dish I liked.
Hmm, it was well-cooked, with some peas, bean shouts, and flowers to bring in fresh flavour.
The sauce was not too heavy, which I personally liked.
The side potato was, which I would call, a "potato cake", that is, the chef slices the potato into thin sheets, decks them together and then either ovens or fries into the shape.
This was a cute idea but it was dry and greasy; in fact, I only finished half of the potato.

The fun part of this restaurant was, some of their wine are pulled, or actually pumped, from a gigantic bottle.
It was such a fun show.
Maybe that was how they get their Michelin one star?

Fastforward to the last dessert "Summer peach tartlet with lavender; chilled punch".
This was a total disaster!
The base tart meant to be crunch but I am not sure if it was a bit too wet or a bit too dry.
The topping peach was neither cold nor warm; a dessert spoon cannot easily cut through.
The best part of this dessert was the light lavender flavour.

Sadly, this was yet another restaurant I disliked in London.
I have to say, although one can get various food in London, they were all not as good as other michelin-stared restaurants in other cities, such as Paris or Milano.

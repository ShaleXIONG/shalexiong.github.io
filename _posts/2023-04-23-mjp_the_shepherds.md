This is a small restaurant and hotel in edge of Cambridge, namely Fen Ditton.
Although it is different to compare here with many other restaurants in my posts, but given the friendly price, I will recommend it.
I went with a close friend and we all thought it is a nice place.

The menu is mostly a la carte but they also provide set menu.
For us, we went for the latter.
Among 5-6 dishes we got, a pea mousse made me very happy.
The mousse had very smooth texture, with a summer vegetable flavour rather than sugary sweet.
A small spoon of ice-cream added a bit milky and creamy flavour, and then the top decoration of pea shoots reminded me my own garden, where I also grow some pea.
It was probably the most well-thought dish in the set, since the plate is likely to be a special chosen one, too.

After this we also got a salad kind of dish, which also follows the sense of vegetable and green.
This time was paired with sun dried tomatoes and a small potato.
It is true that the chef can cut the most tender part of the stems, though I found myself not mind much.
Of course, if he spends more time on polishing every dish to absolutely perfect, the price tag will not be under Â£100.

I did get a bit disappointed by the main beef, where the main problem is the sauce is a bit too liquid.
Also, I could tell they do not have a good thought on the dessert.
Both main beef and desserts' pictures are not given in the post.

However, I want to say this is still a worth to visit place in my opinion.
It is a very relax and family place.
You do not feel the need to dress up in fancy and formal clothes.
You can simply walk in on a weekend and enjoy a nice lunch or dinner.

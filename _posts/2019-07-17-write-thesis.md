When I am back from an internship with [arm][1] at the beginning of July 2019,
I am in thesis mode now.
The internship was very cool and productive, so hopefully I have the chance to go back.

I spent some time to set up a macro in LaTeX.
The [_xparse_][2], [_xstring_][3], and [_listofitems_][4] packages are very useful to define very powerful 
and compressed macros.

This was my friend's birthday dinner.
The restaurant has a very nice environment, locating inside the Mandarin Oriental in Munich.
I have requested Omakase menu, basically a set menu, when booking.
Yet my friend does not eat any red meat, hence the main beef dish for him was replaced by a salmon.

The first non-traditional sashimi was an interesting start.
The yellowtail was in a good quality.
Although Japanese will be frightened to see, Jalape√±o and Coriander added very strong flavours on top of no-taste yellowtail.
The soy sauce seasoning was not very strong but added umani into the taste.

The following sashimi salad (picture is not given) is in a similar style: traditional Japanese with some western seasoning.
Then we got the sushi set.
It was ok and only ok.
The ingredients are fresh.
However, the last two pieces, prawn and especially squid, have too much wasabi inside.

Let talk about the biggest problem or disappointment from the menu, the beef or steak.
It was nice that the steak is sliced so I can eat with chopsticks.
The taste, well, is way too salty combining with light chilli and nothing more.
I had to mix the beef with the daikon to swallow the beef.

Let me put it clear, I will give only one score, if not ZERO, out of five for this restaurant on the food.
I was also not happy on the service to some degree.
I contacted the restaurant regarding my friend is pestercarian but I had to remind the waiter again while we seated in.
More disappointingly, I requested a birthday cake but I never got it.

I decided to have short break in Lyon France and reserved this restaurant.
I literally booked a hotel that is one-minute-walk away from the restaurant.
It was a very unlucky trip, since my flight in the previous night was cancelled and British Airways rebooked me to the first flight in the morning of my restaurant reservation.
Fortunately I got in restaurant in time.
The menu was simple; I ordered the entire set.

The first course was very interesting, crab meat with tropical fruits.
More importantly, the foam on top was actually tasted something; it provided a strong acid seasoning that boosts my palate from the kiwi and avocado flavours.
The crab meat was pretty much non-existed compared to other ingredients except adding some protein and texture between the soft fruit cubes.
In short, it was a great start.

The next dish, snail, is a French traditional ingredient.
Personally I loved it.
Because of the "Grenobloise Style", the dish was towards greasy and butter-flavoured end.
However the almostly no-taste potato gnocchis absorbed much sauce and made the entire dish better balanced.
Though they are certainly in great quality, the snails, well, were just tasted snails.

The most fun and probably show-off dish was "Cevennes Lake Char in Beeswax".
The waitress presented me the raw lake char bout 20 minutes ahead, and poured the warm wax into the container that just soaked the entire char.
The char were just in front of me while I enjoyed other dishes.
The waitress then took back the char to kitchen, seasoned it and reprsented it in a plate.
The end result was a mixed feeling.
Obviously the char was cooked in low temperuture, hence I found that it was slightly cold yet very tender, with the help of sauce.
The fried Artichoke was looked nice, and tasted sweet.
I had to say, I was entertained on the way of cooking but not impressed at all on the flavour.

Now let talk about something all other restaurants should follow: since I do not enjoy cheese board, the restaurant provide a very nice yogurt alternative.
The yogurt was beyond my expectation!
It was very creamy, actually sticky, but not pasty nor too cold at all.
In fact, there were even three jam flavours, which shows a great thought for people who do not like cheese board.

The restaurant provided a great service, with pretty much one waiter per table.
Given the two-star status, the quality was there for sure, though not many surprises. 
However, the main problem for me was that it took way too long, almost three hours, for the lunch service from beginning to the end, while I was simply on my phone in the three-hour waiting journal.
To their defence, they wanted to ensure all the dishes were perfact.
However, the slowness was certainly not a friendly restaurant for an individual customer; I simply felt bored and wanted to leave in the end.

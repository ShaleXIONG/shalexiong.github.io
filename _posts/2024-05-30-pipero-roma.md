This was my second last minute book when I was in Rome, travelling with my parents.
I offered if they wanted to join but they preferred Chinese food themselves.
Maybes I had too high expectation, since many restaurants I tried previously in Italy were all exceptional, nonetheless, this restaurant was very disappointed.
The restaurant locates in a main road and I was the first customer in the evening.
I was happy that I get a table at the corner and next to the window: sometime I enjoy to observe other customers during meal.

I requested the longest menu with ten courses when made the reservation.
Yet I did not get the details of the menu in the entire night.
Given my photos and my memory, the set included: a melon starter, beef tartare, oyster, then one risotto, two pastas, first fish main, second beaf steak then two desserts.
I like the beginning of the set, that is, the melon starter and beef tartare.
Fruity melon starter was kind of fun, especially in the summer.
The herb on top made it more like a dish rather than a plate of fruit.
In fact I really enjoyed this dish although it was a simple idea.

The following beef tartare was also very enjoyable.
Compared with beef tartare in common restaurants, which looks messing and mixes with sauces and herb,
here it was presented very 'clean', just beef, a bit of sauce on top and some vegetable (cabbage if I remembered) slice.
I certainly enjoyed a lot on the fresh beef not overwhelming by seasoning and herbs.
The cabbage made every bites crunchy and enhanced the freshness focus of this dish.

Then, things went down way too fast, at least to me.
I could not remember much on the risotto nor two pastas, apart from, they filled my stomach.
The first fish main was especially boring; in fact, when I am writing this post, I am even questioning myself, was it even fish or something more creative, for example, tofu?
Anyway if it was actually fish, it was a bit overcooked and no sauce, therefore too dry.

Then the second steak main (no picture is shown here), was just a steak one will expect when pay 200 Euros (without wines) for a dinner.
Also, the set contains two raw-beef factors, beef tartare and steak.
I will put a different red meat or even poultry as the second main.

So a short summary: a no from me.

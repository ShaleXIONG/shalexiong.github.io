It was a valentine special night, and I am dining out with a colleague who shares the ski trip together.
The restaurant might be confused by our potential "relationship", because none of us tried to dress up for the evening and we talked about random things during the entire evening.
The restaurant is outside of town, next to a castle.
Unfortunately, we did not find time to visit the castle in the day and it was closed when we arrived.
It is a beautiful restaurant inside, two large dinning areas with only a few tables per room.
The menu was special for valentine day, however, I am not sure how much difference from the regular dinner set.
Also it was in Italian and there is no English version.

The first course after canapé was beef tartar, which I always liked.
Compared with the stereotype, cold with spicy, the chef made it closer to mouth temperature, so it did not freeze my brain, and paired with pretty much no spicy but squash/pumpkin, which led a very interesting smoothy and creamy taste.
The beef itself was also tasted creamy; which tasted more like butter than meat.
The decorated pasta turned out to be harder but was fun to have.
It certainly gave me a different prospective of what a chef can do on a simple and traditional beef tartar.

We then get two fish starters/entrées, a prawn tail and a pan-fried white fish (pictures are not given here).
Both are well-executed as what you will expect from this level of restaurants.
Then it came to the two pasta dishes as very common in Italy.
I enjoyed both.
First was a seafood tortelli, or I should say seafood paired with Tortelli; the fill of the tortelli was actually cabbage.
I liked the fresh tone of this dish, in contrary to the common creamy and/or tomato-based tones.
I can taste the seafood part very well because of the light seasoning.
Tortelli themselves had slightly dried skin but in a very good way, because it added strong texture when biting in.

The second pasta gnocchi was very impressive.
It contrasts very well to the previous tortelli because the gnocchi was very creamy with a drizzle of truffle sauce.
The gnocchi is made very well without the annoying rubbery-texture boundary of gnocchi one might get from other place.
It was simply melted inside mouth.
Apparently the chef's secret was a special bread of potato.

This is certainly a restaurant good for special event because of the location, interior decoration and service quality.
The dishes were as expected, with care and of good taste.
The two pasta dishes were my favourite without doubt.
However, it was not impressive to me, hence I probably will score three out of five.

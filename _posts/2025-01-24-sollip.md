I was on my trip to Zurich, for the next day morning, hence in a very good mood.
On the train to London, I made a last minute book to this restaurant.
I also asked a friend, let's refer as the "doctor" as he is a gynaecologist, since I have not seen him for a while.
The restaurant is around London Bridge but in a quiet neighbourhood.
We were there for an early dinner, yet more customers arrived after us.
Regarding the menu, it does not look much Asian style, but I did not realise it is a Korean cuisine restaurant until the first few dishes.

The first bites was very fun, beef tartare and, if I remember, a daikon/mooli roll.
The beef tartare has a bit of chilli flavour, probably from a drizzle of kimchi (I think the waitress mentioned it).
The dark or cement-colour biscuit on top of the beef was cute, adding a different colour to this canapé.
The daikon canapé was formatted and with very nice fresh and crunchy taste to open the scene.

My favourite dish of the night was the monkfish.
It was a perfectly cooked monkfish paired with a nice green vegetable on top and a dark red chilli and slightly sweet sauce.
The monkfish was very fresh, of very firm fish meet.
The topping green vegetable and a drizzle of chilli powder were contrasting amazingly with the monkfish.
Although it is slightly too watery, the sauce did a fabulous job to add layer of flavouring.
My friend was asking me about the passion fruit in the sauce; it was very subtle but actually was an interestingly hidden taste in the sauce.

The main is loin after the light but bitter-focused soup, "Nurugji".
I had to say, the beef loin was less good as the monkfish.
The problem is exactly the style of this restaurant: the sauce is a bit too watery, which is less good for red meat.
The slice I got also has a bit too much fat and I could not chew hence leave them untouched.
The side was not remembering neither.
Therefore, it was an ok main dish.

Last I want to mention the light dessert of "lychee and jasmine" or I should say a small bowl of flavoured ice a good way.
It was not super sweet from the lychee, with a pleasant taste of jasmine.
Maybe it was a bit cold for winter but after all the dishes, a touch of cold was super nice.

The restaurant has a distinguished style, (1) a light-and-watery sauce, (2) introduction of bitter-flavour ingredients (also common in Japanese cuisine), and (3) a touch of Korea kimchi or chilli powder.
Obviously the chef cooked many ingredients in the western way, however, I especially liked the add of kimchi and chilli powder in several plates, because it is the character or even the stereotype of Korea cuisine, which is unique and never found in other cuisines.

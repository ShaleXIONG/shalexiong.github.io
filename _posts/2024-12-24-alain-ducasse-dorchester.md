It was another year of Christmas Eve and another year of a dinner with "daddy".
We walked from British Museum to Hyde Park.
The Christmas Eve dinner started at 10pm.
It was very busy outside of the restaurant as the enter for the night is located in the hall of the hotel.
We certainly dressed up for the evening, in black tie, but some customers are in much more relaxing clothes, which I was wondering if they even followed the dressing code.
Those under-dressed customers became our gossip topic for the evening.
The menu was very Christmas for sure.

The first dish "langoustine" was very impressive.
The base soup was surprisingly in a cold temperature, which was a very good start as it completely woke me up.
The langoustine were cooked through, i.e., not raw, but still juicy, and the top
Other seasoning were inspired by Japanese, wakame seaweed and citrus.
The drizzle of caviar added some salty and fresh flavours.

Let move to the "sea bass".
It was perfectly cooked and seasoning.
The chef actually fried the sea bass to a slightly golden colour for a nice appearance and flavour, but maintained juice.
The paired watercress and cauliflower balanced the fat from the fish very well.

The main dish for the night was "Guinea fowl", a very traditional choice.
It was another dish I enjoyed.
Starting from the top, truffle, they tasted nice but did not overpower the fowl.
Then the fowl were visually cut very nicely and cooked in a very nice brown-pink-brown colour, with all the extra fat rendering out and removed.
The meat itself were tasted juice but not too bloody, warm temperature but not too hot.
The sauce, which were made from grape condiment, was in a very nice thickness, stick the fowl but not too gluey, and it adds slightly fruity flavour to balance the rich fowl flavour.

It was a great evening.
I liked it, daddy liked it, and eventually some restaurants in London meeting my expectation (given the price).
Apart from the nice dinner, we are facing a table of six persons, probably three couples, some of who are in short and jeans.
They were certainly a source of our entertaining for the night: daddy and I criticised fiercely on their dressing and constantly going out for cigarette.

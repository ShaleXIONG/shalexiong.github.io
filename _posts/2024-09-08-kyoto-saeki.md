This was a fun night.
The dinner started very late around 8pm.
I suspected that it was the second serve when all the customers did not speak Japanese.
It was a very surprise that the restaurant has two waitresses or assistants who can speak Chinese.
I have a brief chat with the younger Chinese lady.
She said she wants to learn and eventually starts his own restaurant, which was very inspiring.
She is also the person doing all the English commentating.
The restaurant insides was very nice with a great view to a garden.

Before jumping into the omakase, I would want to say the restaurant provides bottle tea, which is very cute.
I ordered an entire bottle of green tea and also got the bottle as a souvenir.
I was amazed since the tea taste very nice without any bitter taste when brew in hot water.

After some light bites, the first main course was light-grilled fish (I cannot remember the type of fish).
The golden colour skin looked very appealing and also was tasted crispy.
Because of the extremely light seasoning, it almost liked a sushi, as one can still taste the original flavour of the fish.

The sushi started from, I believe, tuna; the dark red was very attractive.
The shallowed cuts on the surface of the fish held more soy sauce, which was brushed by the chef before serving.
Both the rice and fish were not too cold, in a nice temperature; they are taste well-balanced and fresh.
I barely tasted any wasabi, though I remember the chef dotted some at the back of the fish.

The next one I found impressed was squid.
The light soy sauce brush atop pure white squid made the entire sushi very appealing.
Squid was sticky and chewy but not too jelly-ish texture; I often found jelly texture annoying.

Half way the sushi, the chef provided salmon roe paired with shredded crab meat.
It is an interesting thought to pause the sushi set, which gives me a time to breath.
The only problem was I found it was a bit too cold.

I recall the last sushi was eel.
It was my first to have eel that had pretty much no seasoning but soy sauce.
I was curious on the unique eel-taste but not as strong as I expected.
I was not sure if I liked or disliked on eel sushi, however, I was sure it was well-made.

The restaurant provided not much sushi, around 8-10 pieces.
However, with some small bites and a soup at beginning, I felt very full by the end.
I will recommend because the friendly and chatty environment, and of course, the great work on the sushi set.
However, I should say that sushi is a genre much more relying on the ingredients and difficult to make them a "surprise".
I will certainly be curious how they can make it to the next level.
Before I left my seat, I was very appreciated that the main chef came out and gave me his name card.

I am a research engineering in at [Arm][18], focusing on formal verification and security.
My work involves in examining specifications, protocol designs and software implementations and prototyping verification strategies for increasing their quanlity and security.
Most common techniques we are using includes model checking, fuzzing, and even theorem prover.
Although a full autogenerated verification stack is probably the untimate goal and dream of many verification specialists, my work put emphasis on scalability and bugs hunting with a minimum interruption to the product development cycle.
[HERE IS MY CV.][19]

I received PhD in Computer Science from [Verified Trustworthy Software Specification Group][23], [Dept. of Computing][21], [Imperial College][22], supervised by [Prof. Philippa Gardner][24],
working on verification of concurrent programs and consistency models of distributed systems and databases.
I received MSc. in Advanced Computing from [Imperial College London][22] in 2015, and BEng. in Software Engineering from [Southwest Jiaotong University][25] ([西南交通大学][20]), China in 2014.

## My Hobbies ## 

### Cooking and Restaurants ###

I enjoying cooking for myself of a Chinese style food based on available ingredients.
I grew up in [Changsha, Hunan][29] and spent another 4 years as undergraduate in [Chengdu, Sichuan][30],
so I am familiar to spicy and chilli food.

I spent a portion of my leisure and travelling on trying restaurants, in particular, those often being referred as fine-dining restaurants. 

### Gaming, on PC ###

I like RPG, simulation and strategy games.
Some games I like:

* [Stellaris][5]
* [Civilization V and VI][6]
* [Frostpunk][16]
* [Tropico 4, 5 and 6][7]
* [Two Point Hospital][8]
* [Total War: Warhammer II][9]
* [The Elder Scrolls V][10]
* [Mess Effect 3][17]
* [Divinity: Original Sin 1 and 2][11]
* [The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt][12]
* [FF14][26]
* [Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2][27]

I am still playing [World of Warcraft][28] regularly, in both raid and mythic+.

There are few games I am no long play 
but I still watch matches:

* [Starcraft 2][13]
* [Dota 2][14]

### [Mahjong (麻将)][1] ###

It is a game played by four people.
In China, different areas have slightly different rules but the general rules are similar.

Every player has 13 tiles in their hands and can only be seen by players themselves by default.
There are 3 suits, each of which contains four duplicated tiles from number one to nine.
Some areas also have extra tiles and each of them also have four duplications 
(with few exceptions, but they do not really affect the rule but affect how much a player(s) pay when losing).

Initially players get 13 tiles and afterwards the game is organised by rounds until a player(s) win.
A round is divided into four turns for the four players.
In the counter-clock order players draw a new tile and then discard a tile chosen by themselves .
Note that a play always has 13 tiles either hidden or seen by everyone (there is a mechanism to reveal tiles).
To win, a player's 13 tiles plus an extra one need to form certain pattern.
The extra one can be the immediate new tile the player draws before s/he dicards any tile;
or it can be tiles other players discards in his/her turn.
